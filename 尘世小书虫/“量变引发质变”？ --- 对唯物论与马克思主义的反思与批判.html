<p>“量变引发质变”？ --- 对唯物论与马克思主义的反思与批判</p><p>马克思主义理论体系中许多重要观点,在社会发展和科学进步进程中,已经不能适用或被证明是错误的。追随者需要在承袭马克思主义科学精神的同时,修正和发展其理论体系。</p><p>比如说：</p><p>1. 社会发展的必然规律。马克思主义认为社会按照历史唯物主义所定的必然规律发展,这一观点被证明是错误的。社会发展受多种因素的影响,没有必然的发展轨迹。</p><p>2. 阶级斗争和社会革命的必然性。马克思主义认为社会要实现跃迁必须经历阶级斗争和革命,这一观点被证明是过时的。许多社会转型可以通过渐进改良和民主进程来实现。</p><p>3. 共产主义社会的到来。马克思主义预言资本主义必然崩溃,共产主义社会必然到来,这一预言被证明没有依据。实践证明,资本主义社会没有崩溃,共产主义社会也没有广泛到来。</p><p>4. 生产力决定社会意识形态。马克思主义认为社会的意识形态由经济基础的发展决定。这一论点被证明太过简单化,社会意识形态的演变更加复杂。</p><p>5. 价值论和劳动价值理论。马克思主义的价值论和劳动价值理论被主流经济学理论抛弃,被证明在说明价格形成机制方面不足。</p><p>“量变引发质变”耳熟能详，它是一个著名的哲学原理，也是一个辩证唯物主义的观点。《资本论》第一卷就说:“当积累到一定程度,量的变动必然要引起质的变动。”这句话清晰地阐明了这个观点。</p><p>这个观点主要阐述:大多数情况下，长期的微小变化会在某个阶段突然导致重大的变化或突破。这种变化或突破是由累积的微小变化引起的，这些微小变化可能不会显著改变系统的整体特性，但如果这些微小变化持续积累，最终将引起系统的质变或根本性变化。</p><p> 任何事物都有量和质两个方面。量指事物的大小、 密集程度,质指事物的本质属性、性质等。在一定条件下,量的变化是渐进的、数量上的变化。但当量的积累达到一个临界点,质会发生跃迁,产生根本性变化。这是因为质是建立在量的基础上的,量的变化会促使质的变化。例如,水在加热过程中,温度作为量不断增加,但在到达100°C这个临界点时,水突然变为水汽,质变了。这就是"量变引发质变"的示例。 这个观点说明,任何事物的发展都是渐进的,但在关键时刻都会产生突破,实现飞跃。量的积累为质的飞跃提供了基础。</p><p>马克思主义哲学深受黑格尔辩证法的影响,采用辩证的观点来分析事物的发展变化。“量变引发质变”就是马克思主义哲学中的一个重要原理,用于说明事物发展的辩证法规律。 辩证唯物论作为马克思主义哲学的一部分,同样采用这一原理。它认为世界是物质的,并按照固有的辩证法规律发展变化着。“量变引发质变”就是说明事物发展变化的基本规律之一。“量变引发质变”作为一条发展规律,是马克思主义对辩证法和辩证唯物论在自然与社会发展中的具体应用。它启发了马克思主义的许多理论,例如社会革命理论等。</p><p>“量变引发质变”并非是必然的，它只是一种理论原理，描述了事物发展的一种可能性。在某些情况下，微小的变化并不足以引起根本性的质变。但是如果我们观察历史上发生的革命、重大变化、科学技术创新等，常常会发现它们都是由连续的小变化引起的，最终导致了极其深刻的质变。因此，我们可以将“量变引发质变”原理视为一种倾向性的指导，而不是一种必然性的判断，它可以帮助我们了解事物发展的规律，但不能绝对地应用于所有情况。在实际应用中，我们需要根据具体问题具体分析，结合历史和实践进行判断。</p><p>“量变引发质变”的观点可以追溯至古代哲学家兼科学家阿那克萨戈拉（Anaxagoras）。但是，这个观点在马克思主义和唯物论中也有着重要的地位。马克思主义认为，人类历史的演变是由各种矛盾力量的作用和相互制约的。这些力量通过长时间的斗争和运动，最终会突破边界，引起根本性的质变。同样地，唯物论也强调了物质世界的连续性和变化性，认为量变积累到一定程度时必然会导致质变。因此，“量变引发质变”的观点可以说是马克思主义和唯物论思想的一个重要组成部分。</p><p>但是在现代科学尤其是非线性科学的发展下,已经有更加严密的理论来阐述类似的观念,例如潜在态理论、相变理论等,它们提供了更加精细和量化的理论阐述。潜在态理论和相变理论,提供了更精细和量化的理论基础。它们认为,质变出现的"临界点"不是固定的,而是系统的"吸引子",当系统进入其影响范围,就会发生相变。这种理论提供了更加动态和概率论的理解。另外， 质变的出现取决于许多因素,量的累积只是其中之一。其他因素还包括系统的稳定性、环境影响、随机性等,这使得质变具有一定的偶然性。因此,“量变引发质变”不应被视为一个定量或唯一的规律,它主要起到启发作用 - 指出我们应该关注量与质的具体关系,关注事物发展过程中量的累积可能导致的质的跃迁,这有利于我们在实践中作出合理判断。但我们也需要考虑其他因素,评估质变出现的概率,而不是认为它是绝对必然的。在实践判断与决策中,我们可以运用这个观点去分析某系统的量的变化趋势,考虑它接近某"临界点"的可能性,并据此推测可能出现的质变,做好相应准备。但同时也要考虑其他因素,综合判断质变出现的概率,不应将它视为确定发生。所以,总结来说,“量变引发质变”是一个重要的启发性原理,我们在理论与实践中都可以运用它,但需要对其限制有清醒的认识,理解质变的偶然性与不确定性,做到综合分析和判断。它为我们提供了一个角度去洞察事物发展的规律,但不是唯一或定量的规律。</p><p>"Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes"? - Reflections and criticisms on materialism and Marxism.</p><p>Many important viewpoints in the Marxist theoretical system have been proven to be inapplicable or incorrect in the process of social development and scientific progress. Followers need to revise and develop their theoretical system while inheriting the scientific spirit of Marxism.</p><p>For example:</p><p>1. The inevitability of social development. Marxism believes that society develops according to the inevitable laws of historical materialism, but this viewpoint has been proven to be incorrect. Social development is influenced by multiple factors and does not have a predetermined trajectory.</p><p>2. The inevitability of class struggle and social revolution. Marxism believes that society must undergo class struggle and revolution to achieve a leap forward, but this viewpoint has been proven to be outdated. Many social transitions can be achieved through gradual reform and democratic processes.</p><p>3. The arrival of a communist society. Marxism predicts that capitalism will inevitably collapse and that a communist society will inevitably arrive, but this prediction has been proven to be unfounded. In practice, capitalist society has not collapsed, and communist society has not widely arrived.</p><p>4. The production forces determine the ideology of society. Marxism believes that the ideology of society is determined by the development of the economic base. This argument has been proven to be too simplistic, and the evolution of social ideology is more complex.</p><p>5. The theory of value and labor theory of value. Marxism's theory of value and labor theory of value have been abandoned by mainstream economic theory and have been shown to be insufficient in explaining the mechanism of price formation.</p><p>"Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes" is a well-known philosophical principle and a viewpoint of dialectical materialism. The first volume of "Capital" states, "When accumulated to a certain degree, changes in quantity inevitably lead to changes in quality." This sentence clearly explains this viewpoint.</p><p>This viewpoint mainly states that in most cases, long-term small changes will suddenly lead to significant changes or breakthroughs at some stage. This change or breakthrough is caused by accumulated small changes, which may not significantly change the overall characteristics of the system, but if these small changes continue to accumulate, they will eventually lead to a qualitative or fundamental change in the system.</p><p>Everything has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantity refers to the size and density of things, while quality refers to the essential attributes and properties of things. Under certain conditions, changes in quantity are gradual and quantitative changes. But when the accumulation of quantity reaches a critical point, quality will undergo a leap and undergo fundamental changes. This is because quality is based on quantity, and changes in quantity will promote changes in quality. For example, in the process of heating water, the temperature increases as a quantity, but when it reaches the critical point of 100°C, the water suddenly turns into steam, undergoing a qualitative change. This is an example of "quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes". This viewpoint explains that the development of anything is gradual, but breakthroughs will occur at critical moments to achieve leaps. The accumulation of quantity provides a basis for the leap of quality.</p><p>Marxist philosophy is deeply influenced by Hegelian dialectics, adopting a dialectical viewpoint to analyze the development and changes of things. "Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes" is an important principle in Marxist philosophy, used to explain the dialectical laws of the development of things. Dialectical materialism, as a philosophy of Marxism, emphasizes the unity of opposites, the negation of negation, and the transformation of quantity into quality, and provides a scientific basis for understanding the laws of social development.</p><p>"Quantitative change leads to qualitative change" is not necessarily a certainty; it is just a theoretical principle that describes one possibility for the development of things. In some cases, minor changes may not be enough to cause fundamental qualitative changes. However, if we look at revolutions, major changes, scientific and technological innovations that have occurred in history, we often find that they are caused by continuous small changes that ultimately lead to profound qualitative changes. Therefore, we can view the principle of "quantitative change leads to qualitative change" as a tendency rather than a certainty. It can help us understand the laws of the development of things, but cannot be applied absolutely to all situations. In practical applications, we need to analyze specific problems according to specific circumstances and make judgments based on historical and practical considerations.</p><p>The viewpoint of "quantitative change leads to qualitative change" can be traced back to the ancient philosopher and scientist Anaxagoras. However, this viewpoint also holds an important position in Marxism and materialism. Marxism holds that the evolution of human history is the result of the action and mutual restraint of various conflicting forces. These forces, through long-term struggle and movement, will eventually break through boundaries and cause fundamental qualitative changes. Similarly, materialism also emphasizes the continuity and variability of the material world, believing that quantitative accumulation will inevitably lead to qualitative changes. Therefore, the viewpoint of "quantitative change leads to qualitative change" can be regarded as an important part of Marxist and materialist thought.</p><p>However, in modern science, especially in the development of nonlinear science, there are more rigorous theories that explain similar concepts, such as potential state theory and phase transition theory, which provide more refined and quantitative theoretical explanations. These theories suggest that the "critical point" at which qualitative changes occur is not fixed, but rather the "attractor" of the system. When the system enters its range of influence, a phase transition occurs. This theory provides a more dynamic and probabilistic understanding. In addition, the occurrence of qualitative changes depends on many factors, and quantitative accumulation is only one of them. Other factors include the stability of the system, environmental influences, randomness, etc., which make qualitative changes somewhat accidental. Therefore, "quantitative change leads to qualitative change" should not be viewed as a quantitative or unique rule. It mainly plays an inspiring role in pointing out the specific relationship between quantity and quality in the development of things, and the accumulation of quantity may lead to qualitative leaps. This is conducive to our making reasonable judgments in practice. However, we also need to consider other factors and assess the probability of qualitative changes occurring, rather than assuming that they are absolutely inevitable. In practical judgments and decisions, we can use this viewpoint to analyze the trend of quantity changes in a certain system, consider the likelihood of it approaching a "critical point," and speculate on the possible qualitative changes that may occur accordingly, and prepare accordingly. But at the same time, we also need to consider other factors, make comprehensive judgments on the probability of qualitative changes occurring, and not regard them as certain. Therefore, in summary, "quantitative change leads to qualitative change" is an important inspiring principle that can be applied in both theory and practice, but we need to have a clear understanding of its limitations and understand the contingency and uncertainty of qualitative changes, and achieve comprehensive analysis and judgment. It provides us with a perspective to understand the laws of the development of things, but it is not the only or quantitative rule.</p>
