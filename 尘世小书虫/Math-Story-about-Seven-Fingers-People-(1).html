        <div class="show-content">
          <p>Some where on earth, there is a kingdom. All the people live there only has seven fingers.</p><p>For a long time, 7 fingers people are using the same math as we 10 fingers people learned. But one day, the king of seven fingers kingdom find it is not easy for his people to do the counting as 10 fingers people doing. So he decided to ask Eric's help to create a new math textbook for their kids - &lt;The Mathematics for Seven-Fingers People&gt;.</p><p>Eric is very glad to do that. So he take it as a challenge.</p><p>At first, Eric is thinking how 7 fingers people count numbers. that will be…</p><p>1,2,3,4,5,6,?</p><p>11,12,13,14,15,16,?</p><p>21,22,23,24,25,26,?</p><p>31,32,33,34,35,36,?</p><p>...</p><p>Then Eric is thinking what the ADDITION will be for 7 fingers people.So he listed the addition table below:</p><p>1+1=?</p><p>1+2=?</p><p>1+3=?</p><p>1+4=?</p><p>1+5=?</p><p>1+6=?</p><p>2+5=?</p><p>2+6=?</p><p>10+1=?</p><p>...</p><p>11+6=?</p><p>...</p><p>12+1=?</p><p>...</p><p>16+1=?</p><p>20+1=?</p><p>...</p><p>After addition will be SUBTRACTION， so Eric made the subtraction table.</p><p>1-1=?</p><p>2-1=?</p><p>3-1=?</p><p>10-1=?</p><p>11-1=?</p><p>...</p><p>20-1=?</p><p>20-13=?</p><p>...</p><p>MULTIPLICATION is Eric's next task. So he made the &lt;Times table&gt; for 7 fingers people. It is somehow like below:</p><div class="image-package">

</div><p>7 fingers people will know:</p><p>1*1=?</p><p>2*2=?</p><p>3*3=?</p><p>3*4=?</p><p>5*6=?</p><p>11*11=?</p><p>10*5=?</p><p>12*4=?</p><p>In the reversed way of multiplication, Eric also clear about Division. So same of the examples like below:</p><p>21/5=?</p><p>22/4=?</p><p>60/6=?</p><p>Eric was also thinking about the unit of time for 7-fingers people. He decided not to change it as he thought it might invented by 6 or 12 fingers people. And all over the world is best to use the same way to count the time.</p><p>Eric is going to think more deep. Is 7-fingers people's math completely different then 10-fingers people's math? Or just very similar way like regular math? Is the value of Pi will be different? How can we translate a 7-fingers people's number to 10 digital number, and how we translate it back?</p><p>Eric will try to find the answers on the next episode.</p><p>作者保留版权</p>
