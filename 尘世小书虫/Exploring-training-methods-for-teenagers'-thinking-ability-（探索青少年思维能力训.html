<h1 class="title">Exploring training methods for teenagers' thinking ability （探索青少年思维能力训练方法）</h1>
<div class="show-content">
<p>We often hear such discussions: Child A was clearly very smart as a child, why did he/she become not so good in junior high school/high school/college/society? The reasons may be multifaceted. One factor that cannot be ignored may be that the child's thinking ability did not increase synchronously with age.</p><p>So what exactly is "thinking ability"? What kind of thinking abilities does a person need to have in the process of becoming an adult? How can we train thinking ability? This article will explore and answer related questions.</p><p><b>Thinking ability refers to human ability to think, reason, solve problems and generate creative ideas. </b>It is the ability shown by individuals in the cognitive process, involving various cognitive and psychological processes. Thinking ability depends on two basic elements: thinking patterns and proficiency/flexibility. <b>Thinking patterns are the basic forms or strategies of thinking, representing a person's cognitive approach and thought process. </b>Thinking ability develops on the basis of these basic patterns, measuring the proficiency and flexibility in their application. Thinking patterns are relatively stable for individuals. From childhood, humans gradually develop their own thinking patterns based on innate cognitive frameworks - what we often call Gifted. Along with development, a person will gradually stereotype his own cognitive tendencies. Therefore, in general, after adulthood, thinking patterns are difficult to fundamentally change. Thinking ability is cultivated through continuous learning and practice based on existing thinking patterns. Individuals master multiple thinking patterns at the same time. Thinking ability is reflected in the selection and application of thinking patterns, requiring a clear understanding of different patterns and the ability to accurately choose appropriate patterns according to specific situations. Thinking ability also depends on the accumulation of knowledge and experience, as well as the proficiency of relevant skills. These provide rich materials and means for the application of thinking patterns.</p><p><i>Thinking ability is an external manifestation of whether an individual is intelligent or not. It is an ability that can be continuously improved through training. For example:</i></p><p>1. Logical reasoning ability: Includes thinking processes such as analysis, inference, induction and deduction, used to understand problems, find out rules and relationships, and deduce conclusions from them.</p><p>2. Creative thinking ability: Refers to the ability to generate new perspectives, create new solutions and produce unique ideas. It involves unconventional thinking modes, thinking jumps and associative abilities.</p><p>3. Critical thinking ability: Includes the ability to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of information, challenge assumptions and reasoning, and think about multiple angles and possible explanations of a problem. </p><p>4. Abstract thinking ability: Refers to the ability to understand and process abstract concepts, symbols and models. It involves the ability to abstract general laws and principles from specific things.</p><p>5. Communication and expression ability: The ability to clearly and persuasively express one's thinking, opinions or ideas. This requires organizing specific thinking patterns and effective performance through language.Thinking ability is an external manifestation of an individual's intelligence and an ability that can be continuously improved through training. For example, logical reasoning ability, creative thinking ability, critical thinking ability, abstract thinking ability, communication and expression ability, etc. These abilities involve understanding problems, finding rules, generating new ideas, challenging assumptions, abstracting laws, and clear expression. Improving students' thinking ability is an important goal of education. Schools can improve students' thinking ability through relevant curriculum design, teaching methods and activity organization. Individuals can also improve their thinking ability through extensive reading, brainstorming exercises, debate and discussion, etc.</p><p>Thinking ability is a display of human intelligence and an ability that can be continuously improved through training.</p><p><i>Note: <b>Innate cognitive frameworks</b> refer to the basic cognitive structures and thinking patterns that humans have naturally formed in the evolutionary process. It is different from later learning and experience accumulation, belonging to the psychological structure common to all humans. It mainly includes the following aspects:</i></p><p><i>1. Classification system. Humans have an innate tendency to classify different things, which forms the basic cognitive structure of human beings on the world, such as biological classification and numerical classification.</i></p><p><i>2. Probability and reasoning mechanisms. Humans have an innate mechanism to judge the possibility of things and reasoning, which provides a basis for subsequent cognitive activities and learning. </i></p><p><i>3. Spatial cognition. Humans have an innate ability to judge spatial position and direction, which is the basis of navigation and many skills.</i></p><p><i>4. Concept of quantity. Humans have an innate ability to judge quantity, size and comparison, which is the basis for many cognitive activities and the source of mathematical ability.</i></p><p><i>5. Causal reasoning. Humans have an innate tendency to judge causal relationships between events, which is an important mechanism for explaining the world, predicting results and making decisions. </i></p><p><i>6. Social reasoning. Humans have innate mechanisms to judge the intentions, motives and build trust of others, which is the basis for interpersonal interaction and social activities.</i></p><p><i>7. Language learning mechanism. Humans have an innate ability to learn language, which gives humans an innate ability to acquire language and a basis for linguistic sense.</i></p><p><i>The above are cognitive patterns and psychological structures that humans have gradually formed in the long evolutionary process. They provide a basic framework for various subsequent human learning, communication and cognitive activities, making human thinking patterns stable and universal. These innate thinking frameworks are quite different from neural network algorithms, which rely more on data and training.</i></p><p><i>Therefore, innate thinking frameworks are the product of human evolution and our common basic psychological structure, providing a stable framework for various subsequent cognitive activities and thinking. It is different from later learning and relies mainly on data driven like neural network algorithms. It makes the thinking patterns of human beings maintain a certain commonality in individual differences.</i></p><p>Therefore, how strong a person's thinking ability is depends on both whether he masters different thinking patterns and how proficient and flexible he applies different thinking patterns. <b>The thinking patterns we often use</b> include:</p><p>1. Inductive thinking: Deriving general laws and concepts from specific facts and cases based on observation and experience. For example, a person observes multiple birds, notices that they all have feathers, wings and beaks, and then induces that birds have these common characteristics. </p><p>2. Deductive thinking: Drawing conclusions based on known premises and logical rules. Deducing specific conclusions from general principles or rules. For example, if the premise is "All humans will die", and a person belongs to humans, then it can be deduced through deductive thinking that the person will eventually die.</p><p>3. Critical thinking: This kind of thinking achieves sober judgment by raising objections or doubts about a certain view or theory. For example, when learning a theory, you should learn to question it from various angles, which can avoid easy acceptance and deepen understanding. Critical thinking values independent thinking. </p><p>4. Creative thinking: Can jump out of inherent thinking patterns and be flexible. This kind of thinking is innovative, able to make new judgments according to the situation and avoid thinking patterns. For example, when a plan cannot be implemented, it needs to be adjusted quickly. Flexible thinking is needed to generate new solutions instead of sticking to the original plan.</p><p>5. Logical thinking: Using logical rules and reasoning to process information and problems to ensure consistent and reasonable thinking. For example, when solving math problems, use logical thinking to apply mathematical principles, rules and formulas to deduce the correct answer. Or, when reacting quickly in dangerous situations, intuitive thinking can help us make quick judgments and take appropriate actions.</p><p>6. Analytical thinking: This kind of thinking understands things by breaking down the whole into parts, focusing on rationality and logic. For example, to understand a car, you can analyze parts such as the body, engine, transmission system, and then understand the relationship between them. This helps to accurately understand the internal principles of things. </p><p>7. Synthetic thinking: This kind of thinking forms a new whole by associating and combining different elements, full of creativity. For example, the ancient Chinese invention of nets for fishing combines elements such as lines, knots and rods to form a new tool. This invention requires synthetic thinking, creating a new tool through a new combination of elements.</p><p>8. Analogical thinking: Reasoning and judgment about one thing based on the similarity between two things. This can produce new insights and discoveries. For example, there is an analogy between circuits and water pipe systems, where water flow is like electric current, so water pipes can be used to illustrate the principle of circuits. This example uses the similarity between the two to gain a new understanding.</p><p>9. Intuitive thinking: This kind of thinking relies on personal intuition rather than rational analysis. For example, interviewers need to intuitively judge whether candidates are suitable during interviews, because rational evidence is sometimes impossible. This requires the accumulation of relevant experience and intuitive judgment. </p><p>10. Reflective thinking: Reflecting and evaluating one's own thinking, beliefs and assumptions to improve the quality of thinking and decision making. For example, after completing an assignment, a student reviews his own work and thinks about how to improve it to improve his performance next time.</p><p>11. Divergent thinking: Starting from one point and extending many new associations and connections. This kind of thinking is creative and can produce more new possibilities. For example, creative design requires divergent thinking to generate more new ideas, which helps to choose a better or more innovative design solution.</p><p>12. Systematic thinking: Viewing things from a holistic and systematic perspective, understanding the interdependence between things. This kind of thinking is macro and comprehensive, focusing on the dynamic relationship between things. For example, to understand the ecological environment, systematic thinking is needed to focus on the dynamic relationship between organisms and the environment, rather than isolated individuals. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the operating laws of the entire system.</p><p><b>So how do we exercise the above thinking patterns?</b></p><p>1. Theoretical learning: Learn the theories and characteristics of various thinking patterns and understand the differences between different patterns. This can deepen the cognition and understanding of various thinking patterns and lay the foundation for practical application.</p><p>2. Case analysis: Analyze typical cases or examples that use different thinking patterns. Understand how different thinking patterns work from specific cases, which can help us flexibly apply them in practice. </p><p>3. Scenario simulation: Set up a scenario and then try to use different thinking patterns to solve problems or enhance creativity. This kind of simulation practice can make us proficient in applying various thinking patterns in different scenarios.</p><p>4. Conscious practice: Consciously apply different thinking patterns in daily learning and work, and make a self-review and summary after application. This conscious practice can gradually develop the habit of using these patterns, and continue to improve during application. </p><p>5. Find different perspectives: For the same problem or thing, try to observe and think about it from different perspectives or angles. Different perspectives can stimulate different thinking patterns, which helps to continuously expand thinking breadth and depth.</p><p>6. Pay attention to details and observation: Develop the ability to observe and pay attention to details, discover patterns and associations from subtle places. Practice finding and using information and clues hidden underneath the surface. </p><p>7. Team discussion: In group discussions, consciously adopt different thinking patterns to look at problems and put forward opinions. Observe new ideas proposed by others from different thinking patterns, and discuss the differences and connections between viewpoints. This can mutually stimulate learning and acquire broader ways of thinking in communication. </p><p>8. Use tools: Some thinking patterns can be enhanced and expanded with the help of specific tools or techniques. For example, divergent thinking can be expressed using mind maps, and systematic thinking can be demonstrated using system dynamics models. The application of these tools also helps train related thinking patterns. </p><p>9. Reflection and introspection: Regularly reflect on your own thinking process and decision making, examine your own assumptions and beliefs, and evaluate their effectiveness. Look for opportunities for self-improvement and develop more rational and clear thinking. </p><p>In summary, we can strengthen various thinking patterns through theoretical learning, case analysis, scenario simulation, conscious practice, finding different perspectives, paying attention to details, team discussion, using tools, reflection and introspection. The training of thinking patterns should be purposeful and systematic. Only by continuously enriching experience and strengthening executive ability can thinking ability be effectively improved. </p><p><b>Can children rely on school education to improve their thinking ability? </b>The answer is: yes and no.</p><p>In the long run, offering such courses is undoubtedly very beneficial to students' cognitive and innovative ability development. It helps students develop a more comprehensive and flexible thinking, which is one of the important abilities to adapt to the future social development. Unfortunately, most public schools currently do not offer special thinking pattern courses, mainly for the following reasons:</p><p>1. Curriculum arrangements and requirements: School education usually has a set curriculum arrangement and requirements to cover various disciplines and knowledge areas. Within the limited curriculum time, schools pay more attention to imparting subject knowledge and basic skills to meet teaching objectives and examination requirements. </p><p>2. Focus of curriculum design: School education focuses more on cultivating students' basic knowledge and subject skills, such as mathematics, science, language, etc. These subject educations aim to provide students with academic literacy and prepare them for higher education or the job market. </p><p>3. Its importance is not fully recognized: The importance of thinking patterns has a huge impact on human cognition and creativity, but this impact has not been widely and deeply recognized in the education field. Therefore, there is no strong demand for setting up corresponding courses. </p><p>4. Teaching methods need to be improved: The cultivation of thinking patterns requires integration of theory and practice, but the traditional written test-based teaching evaluation methods are not conducive to such comprehensive learning, which also restricts the setting of such courses.</p><p>5. Insufficient teacher training: Offering new thinking pattern courses requires teachers with relevant knowledge and teaching skills, but the existing teacher training and knowledge building still have considerable room for improvement, which also becomes a limiting factor. </p><p>6. Pending curriculum resource construction: Developing any new course requires investing considerable time and effort in writing teaching materials, cases and other teaching resources. Thinking pattern courses are no exception. This also requires considerable time and effort to promote.</p><p>In summary, whether children can rely on school education to improve their thinking ability depends on many factors. Schools need to improve curriculum design, teaching methods, teacher training, and curriculum resource construction in order to cultivate students' thinking patterns more systematically and effectively. Only by strengthening the teaching and cultivation of thinking patterns can children's thinking ability be substantially enhanced through school education. </p><p><b>Are there any courses in society to train thinking patterns?</b></p><p>In society, there are some special courses and training institutions to train thinking patterns. These courses aim to enhance people's thinking ability and cognitive skills, cultivate their more flexible and efficient thinking in the face of problems, decision making and innovation. The following are some common courses to train thinking patterns:</p><p>1. Critical thinking courses: These courses aim to cultivate people's critical thinking ability and teach them how to evaluate the reliability of information, analyze and interpret arguments, identify logical fallacies, and put forward reasonable arguments and reasoning. </p><p>2. Creative thinking courses: These courses encourage people to develop creative thinking skills, stimulate imagination, cultivate innovative thinking and problem solving skills. The courses may include inspirational activities, training in creative techniques and ways to stimulate creativity. </p><p>3. Problem solving and decision making courses: These courses are dedicated to cultivating people's systematic thinking ability in the face of problems and decision making. Students will learn problem solving methods and tools, such as systems thinking, decision analysis and decision trees. </p><p>4. Cognitive training courses: These courses aim to enhance people's cognitive abilities, including memory, concentration, learning strategies and information processing abilities. These courses can help people better understand and apply what they have learned. </p><p>5. Psychology and neuroscience courses: These courses provide scientific theories and research on human thinking and cognitive processes. Students will learn psychological theories about thinking patterns, memory, learning and decision making, as well as neuroscientific research related to thinking activities. </p><p>6. Mind mapping and concept mapping training: These training courses teach students to use visual tools such as mind maps and concept maps to organize thinking, show associations and enhance thinking flexibility.These courses and training institutions are usually offered in community education centers, university continuing education departments, professional training institutions or online education platforms. People can choose suitable courses according to their interests and needs to improve their thinking skills.</p><p>In summary, there are many courses and training methods in society to help cultivate and improve thinking patterns and cognitive abilities. By selecting appropriate courses for training and practice, people can strengthen flexible thinking skills to adapt to the increasingly complex challenges in work and life. </p><p><b>Are there some plans for teenagers to train themselves to improve their thinking ability?</b></p><p>1. Problem solving training: Give teenagers a problem scenario and ask them to come up with solutions using different thinking patterns. For example, analytical thinking identifies the root cause of the problem, analogical thinking borrows other solution ideas, and divergent thinking generates more options. This can cultivate their systematic thinking ability to solve problems. </p><p>2. Hypothesis training: Provide a simple story framework and ask teenagers to set new hypotheses from different angles to extend the story. This can stimulate their imagination and use divergent and synthetic thinking to expand creativity. </p><p>3. Theory application: Teach teenagers different theoretical knowledge about thinking patterns, and then design scenarios for them to apply theories to solve problems. This can strengthen the integration of theory and practice, internalizing the concepts of thinking patterns into problem-solving skills. </p><p>4. Difference discovery: Provide two similar products, views or ideas, and ask teenagers to find out their differences and connections. Discovering differences from different perspectives requires critical thinking and systematic thinking, which can enhance their comprehensive judgment and understanding. </p><p>5. Role playing: Design a role that requires different thinking patterns, such as engineers, lawyers, advertisers, etc., and ask teenagers to solve problems from the perspective of that role. Playing different roles can experience different thinking postures. It is also an effective way to improve their thinking breadth and flexibility. </p><p>6. Reflection and metacognition training: Cultivate teenagers' metacognitive ability so that they can be aware of and monitor their own thinking processes. Tools such as reflection diaries, mind maps and self-assessment tools can be designed to help them reflect on their own learning and thinking methods, and improve and adjust their thinking strategies.</p><p>7. Team communication: Form a team of teenagers to discuss or brainstorm on a topic. In team discussions, each person puts forward their views from different perspectives or thinking patterns, and then inspires and improves each other. Team communication can strengthen the conversion and integration of thinking patterns. It can also help teenagers apply different ways of thinking in social situations.</p><p>In summary, there are many ways for teenagers to train themselves and improve their thinking skills, such as problem solving training, hypothesis training, theory application, difference discovery, role playing, reflection and metacognition training, and team communication. With systematic training and practice, teenagers can stimulate their imagination, cultivate comprehensive and flexible thinking skills, apply theories flexibly, and improve their ability to solve complex problems. </p><p><i>Note: <b>Metacognition</b> refers to cognition about cognition itself, that is, the ability to observe, understand and regulate one's own cognitive activities such as thinking, learning and remembering. It is an advanced cognitive ability that enables one to think about and monitor one's own thinking processes and make adjustments and optimizations if necessary.</i></p><p><i>Metacognition includes the following abilities and knowledge:</i></p><p><i>1. Awareness and self-observation: Being aware of engaging in cognitive activities, being able to observe and reflect on one's own thinking processes. </i></p><p><i>2. Goal setting and monitoring: Being able to set clear learning or problem solving goals and monitor whether you are moving towards the goals. </i></p><p><i>3. Planning and strategy use: Having the ability to develop effective learning or problem solving strategies and choose appropriate strategies according to task requirements.</i></p><p><i>4. Focus on attention and concentration: Being able to control and regulate attention, focus on learning and thinking, and resist factors that distract and disrupt attention. </i></p><p><i>5. Self-assessment and feedback: Being able to accurately assess one's own learning or performance, give oneself appropriate feedback, identify one's strengths and weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments and improvements.</i></p><p><i>6. Learning and memory strategies: Understanding and applying various learning and memory strategies, such as organizing information, associative memory, review planning, etc., to improve learning effects and memory.</i></p><p><i>The development and improvement of metacognition can be achieved through cultivating the habit of self-awareness and reflection, learning and practicing effective learning strategies, and continuously challenging and expanding one's cognitive abilities. It is important for learning, problem solving and personal development.</i></p><p><i>In summary, metacognition refers to the awareness and understanding of one's own thinking processes. It enables conscious monitoring, regulation and optimization of thinking activities. Metacognition includes abilities such as self-observation, goal setting, strategy use, attention control, self-assessment and application of learning strategies. The cultivation of metacognition relies on the development of self-reflective habits, the mastery of effective cognitive strategies, and the continuous improvement of thinking skills.
