<p>儿子今天带回家的Take home reading是一个小故事&lt;The lion and the rabbit&gt;。故事是这样的：</p><p>A lion felt very hungry, so he went out hunting.</p><p>He caught a rabbit and about to kill it  for his meal</p><p>Then he saw a deer passing by</p><p>"The deer has more meet than the small rabbit. " The lion thought</p><p>He dropped the rabbit and trying to catch the deer, the rabbit ran away</p><p>The deer was so fast and the lion could not catch it</p><p>When he came back and looking for the rabbit. The rabbit was already gone.</p><p>The lion had to back home with an empty stomach that day.</p><p>Daddy: What do you learn from this story?</p><p>Son: I don't know</p><p>Daddy: Let's see, if you are the lion, and you are very hungry, are you going to eat the rabbit?</p><p>Son: Yes</p><p>Daddy: Then you will saw the deer. You know you are a big lion. A rabbit is not enough for your meal, but the deer is. What you think?</p><p>Son: ......(definitely he still remember the story, he knows if lion switches to the deer, most likely he will lost both)</p><p>Daddy: We have to make a lot of choices everyday, let's see how we can make our choice wisely.</p><p>Daddy: When the lion had rabbit in his hand, he is hungry and don't have much energy, right? So when he saw the deer, he has to know: dear runs very fast and he may can not catch it as he is hungry and weak.</p><p>Son: So the lion has to eat the rabbit first, but that he may lost the dear.</p><p>Daddy: true. but in the story, the lion end up nothing to eat. if he keep the rabbit, he will not feel that hungry.</p><p>Son: So the lion should not run for the dear.</p><p>Daddy: not always true. It involves a very important thing. How the lion know himself and the dear? Does the lion knows how fast he can run? Now fast the deer can run? Now fast he can run when he is in hungr?</p><p>Daddy continue: if the lion is little bit smart, he will know that he can not catch the deer when he is very hungry. He'd better eat the rabbit first. Then he may can save some energy to hunt deer. To get this, the lion needs better understanding of himself and learn from this kind of experience. </p>
