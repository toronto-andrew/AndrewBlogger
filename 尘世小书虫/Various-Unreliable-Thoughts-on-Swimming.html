<p>Various Unreliable Thoughts on Swimming We all know the four common and standard competitive swimming styles: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly.<b>Freestyle:</b>Swimmers face down, using alternate arm strokes while kicking their legs. This is the fastest swimming style and the most common in competitions.<b>Backstroke:</b>Swimmers lie on their back on the water's surface, using alternate arm strokes while kicking their legs. The swimmer's face remains above the water, and breathing is achieved by tilting to each side alternately.<b>Breaststroke:</b>Swimmers face forward, extending their arms forward through the water, then moving them inward and finally pushing them back. The leg movement involves a kick and a simultaneous leg closing, with breathing controlled at appropriate intervals.<b>Butterfly:</b>Swimmers face down, extending both arms forward and then performing simultaneous arm strokes backward through the water. The leg movement is similar to the breaststroke's kick and leg closure. Butterfly is one of the most technically demanding swimming styles.</p><p>In addition to these four primary swimming styles, there are also some secondary styles, such as sidestroke (commonly known as sidestroke), underwater gliding, breaststroke glide, dog paddle, etc.<b>Sidestroke:</b>Swimmers lie on their side on the water's surface, extending one arm forward and the other arm downward while kicking their legs. This is a relatively relaxed swimming style suitable for leisure swimming.<b>Underwater Gliding:</b>Swimmers propel themselves underwater using streamlined movements and limited motion, often used in synchronized swimming or artistic swimming routines.<b>Breaststroke Glide:</b>Swimmers perform a glide after each breaststroke kick, maintaining a streamlined position. This is an extension of the breaststroke technique.<b>Dog Paddle:</b>Swimmers keep their body submerged in water while maintaining a standing posture and using a dog-like paddling motion to move forward. This swimming style is suitable for basic movement in shallow water.</p><p>Apart from the previously mentioned swimming styles, there are some uncommon or specialized styles as well. These styles may appear in specific swimming communities, events, or competitions.<b>Rolling Swim:</b>Swimmers perform continuous rolling movements in the water, similar to gymnastics maneuvers. This style is more artistic and is often used in water performances or special events.<b>Diving Swim:</b>Swimmers jump into the water from a diving board and then perform various actions and combinations underwater, similar to figure skating in the air. This is a complex swimming style that requires a high level of skill and coordination.<b>Side Swim:</b>Swimmers lie on their side on the water's surface and perform arm and leg movements. This is a relatively uncommon style that may appear in water fitness classes.<b>Fingertip Swim:</b>Swimmers use fingertip strokes on the water's surface, resembling crawling. This style focuses on hand movements and uses legs less.<b>Gliding Swim:</b>Swimmers keep their body close to the water's surface, resembling gliding, to move forward. This style emphasizes reducing water resistance and is often used for performance or special skill displays.</p><p>Many swimming styles have emerged based on specific pool or water activity needs. For example:<b>Chaotic Swim:</b>Swimmers use various swimming styles and movements to create a unique swimming pattern. This style offers a high degree of freedom and emphasizes creativity and performance.<b>Single-Leg Swim:</b>Swimmers use only one arm and one leg for propulsion, keeping the other side above the water's surface. This style emphasizes balance and coordination.<b>Back Fly Swim:</b>Swimmers combine backstroke arm movements with butterfly leg movements. This is a more specialized style that requires mastering both backstroke and butterfly techniques.<b>Diving Swim:</b>Swimmers jump into the water from a diving platform or board and then perform swimming or other movements. This style combines diving and swimming and is common in water performances and competitions.<b>Upside-Down Swim:</b>Swimmers perform hand and leg movements while inverted underwater. This is a more specialized and challenging style that requires strong physical fitness and coordination.<b>Sitting Swim:</b>Swimmers sit on the water's surface and perform arm and leg movements. This style emphasizes body balance and stability.<b>Rolling Swim:</b>Swimmers perform continuous rolling movements on the water's surface, similar to somersaults. This is a more specialized style that is sometimes used for performances or special skill displays.</p><p>The four standard swimming styles (freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly) have evolved and been optimized over the years. Have they reached the pinnacle of human biomechanics and motion science? Is it possible for humans to create new swimming styles? I mean those that can be widely accepted by the public and integrated into competitions, similar to the four standard swimming styles?</p><p>From a scientific perspective, it is theoretically possible to create new swimming styles, but this requires consideration of multiple factors, including biomechanics, efficiency, safety, and the potential for public acceptance and inclusion in competition rules. I believe it depends on the following aspects:</p><p><b>Biomechanics and Efficiency:</b>The design of a swimming style must consider human biomechanics and movement efficiency. A new style should allow swimmers to comfortably perform strokes, kicks, and breathing while minimizing water resistance to enhance speed and efficiency.</p><p><b>Safety:</b>A new swimming style should not pose health or safety risks to swimmers. Movements and postures during swimming should be aligned with human physiological structures to prevent injuries or discomfort.</p><p><b>Scientific Validation:</b>A new swimming style needs to undergo scientific validation, including biomechanical analysis, kinematics, and kinetic studies. These studies can assess the feasibility, efficiency, and potential advantages of the new style.</p><p><b>Public Acceptance:</b>The acceptance and recognition of a new swimming style by the public are important factors. If a new style is difficult to learn or lacks appeal, it may struggle to gain popularity on a wide scale.</p><p><b>International Competition Rules:</b>A new swimming style must conform to the rules of international governing bodies like FINA or other relevant organizations. These rules ensure fairness and standardization in competitions.</p><p>While it is difficult to predict with certainty, I hope that in the not-so-distant future, we might witness unexpected innovations in this seemingly "least likely to innovate" field of human activity.</p>
