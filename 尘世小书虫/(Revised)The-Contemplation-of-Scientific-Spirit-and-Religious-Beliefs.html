<h1 class="title">(Revised)The Contemplation of Scientific Spirit and Religious Beliefs</h1>
<div class="show-content">
<p>As children gradually grow up, their scientific outlook is also deepening. Parents hope that while strengthening their scientific outlook, children can also have a more tolerant and inclusive attitude towards religious beliefs. Here we will briefly explore the relationship between religious beliefs and the scientific spirit in terms of practical significance, historical significance and philosophical origins.</p><p>First, <b>religion is a belief, while the scientific spirit is not a belief</b>. Belief refers to an inner confirmation or identification, which can be rational or irrational. The object of belief can be mysterious or beyond reason, such as God or other supernatural beings in religious beliefs. Beliefs belong to the spiritual and ideological level, not necessarily requiring rational argument or evidence. Belief is not necessarily directly related to religion. Belief can be believed in anything, including: belief in supernatural existence (such as God). This is within the scope of religious beliefs; belief in a certain value or ideology, such as humanism, liberalism, etc. This transcends specific religions.</p><p>However, if we say belief in scientific theories or doctrines, such as relativity or evolution? This is very controversial. Science and belief (especially religious belief) are similar in some sense, but differ to a greater extent:</p><p>Similarities: Science tries to answer various questions about natural phenomena for mankind and in this sense also provides a means of understanding the world and a spiritual sustenance. Religion is a complete spiritual sustenance. </p><p>The differences are: Science emphasizes reason, evidence and proof. It does not involve belief in the supernatural or the unknowable. The theories that science believes in need to be verified by rational evidence and may change at any time; the purpose of science is to seek objective truth, while the purpose of belief is spiritual meaning, value and life guidance. Science only provides rational understanding, while religion provides faith; scientific conclusions describe natural phenomena, while religious doctrines mostly do not require rational explanation or verification. Scientific conclusions can be falsified, while religious beliefs cannot be falsified; scientific theories can be spread between different cultures, while religious beliefs are often limited to specific cultural circles. Science is more global.</p><p><b>Religion belongs to a specific belief system:</b></p><p>1. It is formed around the belief in supernatural existence or God, which is the core of religious belief. </p><p>2. It includes systematic doctrines, precepts, organizational forms and activities. Religious beliefs promote the formation of congregations. </p><p>3. It tries to answer the mysteries of life and the universe, providing spiritual sustenance and guidance for life. This is the purpose of religious belief. </p><p>4. It profoundly affects believers' values, ways of thinking and living habits. This makes religious belief a way of life.</p><p>Therefore, although science has a similar faith in some respects and tries to answer existing questions, science does not exist because of differences in methodology, purpose and object. Science provides rational understanding, while religious beliefs cover a wider range and rely on intuition and experience rather than pure reason alone. If science is viewed as a spiritual sustenance, it relies more on reason and evidence rather than "belief."</p><p><b>Then what is religion?</b></p><p>- Religion is a belief system that mainly includes the following characteristics:</p><p>- Belief in supernatural existence (such as God), which is the core feature of religion. </p><p>- Doctrinal system, such as explanations of life, universe, concept of good and evil, etc.  </p><p>- Religious organizations have systematic initiation ceremonies, profound doctrines and precepts. </p><p>- Religious activities such as worship, rituals, sacrifices, etc. </p><p>- Scriptures and prophets, many religions have scriptures of divine revelation and founding prophets. </p><p>- Influence lifestyle, religion influences believers' values, ways of thinking and living habits.</p><p><b>How did religion come about?</b></p><p>1. Fear and worship of unknown things. Ancient people were full of fear of unknown things in nature, such as thunder, lightning, diseases, etc. Therefore, they worshipped these phenomena or the deities that governed these phenomena, which gradually evolved into primitive religions.</p><p>2. Questioning the mystery of life. People have doubts about the origin of life, the afterlife, etc. Religious beliefs try to answer these mysteries of life and meet people's spiritual needs. This is an important driving force for the emergence of religion.</p><p>3. Utilization of the ruling class. To consolidate power, the ruling class needs ideological tools to influence and control the people. As an ideological system, religion can play this role, so it is utilized and promoted by the ruling class. </p><p>4. Influence of living habits. People's lifestyles, festival customs, etc. are permeated with various religious colors. These customs gradually evolve into formal religious cultures and doctrines, resulting in new religions. </p><p>5. Emergence of prophets or saints. The emergence of religion is often accompanied by the appearance of a prophet or saint. They preach new religious ideas and doctrines, gather believers, and form new religious organizations. This is the direct cause of the emergence of religion. </p><p>6. Fusion of different cultures. New religions emerge from the mutual influence and fusion of different religious ideas and doctrines. For example, Buddhism was produced under the influence of Hinduism, and Christianity was formed under the influence of Judaism and Greek philosophy. This is an important way for religious evolution. </p><p>Therefore, the emergence of religion is the result of many factors. It originated from primitive worship, arose from questioning the mysteries of life, benefited from the promotion of the ruling class, was influenced by living habits, and evolved with the appearance of prophets and saints and the fusion of different cultures. These are important driving forces for the emergence of religion.</p><p><b>Historically, religion has played a significant role:</b></p><p>1. Religion promotes social cohesion. Primitive religious worship helps tribal members develop a common identity, and religious festivals and rituals enhance social cohesion. As the scale of society expands, religion continues to play this role. </p><p>2. Religion plays a role in maintaining social order. Religious doctrines and moral norms guide people's proper behaviors and avoid social chaos. Religion also strengthens these norms through rituals and punishments. </p><p>3. Religion provides ideological support for rule. Religion is utilized by rulers to provide legitimacy for their rule through the theory of divine right. Religion also appeases the public and reduces conflict. </p><p>4. Religion promotes cultural inheritance. Religious beliefs and activities play a key role in maintaining social traditions and promoting cultural inheritance. Religious festivals and rituals preserve folk traditions. </p><p>5. Religion meets the needs of life. Religious beliefs meet people's quest for the meaning of life and ultimate care, meeting spiritual needs, which is conducive to social stability. </p><p>6. Religion promotes technological progress. Some religious ideas and activities, such as astronomy and architecture, promote technological development. Religious architecture also demonstrates technological capabilities. </p><p>7. Religion influences economic activities. Religious festivals and sacrificial activities stimulate consumption, and religious believers' donations increase social wealth. Some religious concepts such as commercialism also promote economic development.</p><p><b>Religion has important significance in the real world:</b></p><p>1. Give life meaning and direction. Religion teaches people the meaning and value of life, guides the direction of life, and gives people spiritual sustenance and comfort. This is extremely important for some people. </p><p>2. Lead social morality. The various creeds and doctrines put forward by religion influence and guide social moral concepts. It defines what is good and evil and influences people's value judgments. This provides order and benchmarks for society. </p><p>3. Give people psychological support. Religious beliefs can give people psychological support and comfort, especially in times of illness and death. The role of this spiritual sustenance cannot be underestimated. </p><p>4. Foster social cohesion. Religious activities gather crowds, enhance people's familiarity and identity with each other, and thus promote the formation of social cohesion. This plays an important role in social stability. </p><p>5. Preserve cultural heritage. Religious activities contain a wealth of cultural heritage, preserving and inheriting a nation's unique thoughts, arts and ways of life. These are an indispensable part of human civilization. </p><p>6. Respond to human needs. Religious beliefs respond to and meet certain needs of human beings at the spiritual level, such as the needs for eternal life, perfection and redemption. Meeting these needs is of utmost importance for many people. </p><p><b>How does religion in the real world differ from religion in ancient times?</b></p><p>• It has evolved from primitive witchcraft to organized polytheism and then to monotheism. </p><p>• Modern religious doctrines and ideas have been moderately reformed to better suit modern social development and are more progressive than ancient ones. </p><p>• Modern religious organizations are more complete and mature, with higher systematics and greater influence. </p><p>• Modern religious doctrines and lifestyles are more tolerant of scientific knowledge and less conflicting with science. </p><p>• Modern religious followers are more rational, emphasizing individual interpretation rights and freedom of choice, with less blind faith. </p><p>• The role of modern religion is more based on spiritual sustenance and guidance for life, with relatively less political influence. </p><p>• Exchanges and competitions between religions in the modern world are more frequent, with new religious ideas emerging continuously. </p><p>• Modern religion is more deeply influenced by globalization, believers are more diverse, and doctrines have more extensive influence.</p><p><b>What is the relationship between religion and science</b>?</p><p>1. Science and religion are not completely opposed. Science explores the operating principles of nature and the material world, while religion focuses more on the spiritual and meaningful levels. The two can coexist to some extent. </p><p>2. The existence of God is a belief that science cannot prove or falsify. </p><p>3. Religion and faith in God answer many questions that science cannot answer, such as the origin of the universe, the meaning of life, and the afterlife. These are eternal questions of mankind that are often impossible to find scientific answers for in a lifetime. At least religion and God can provide an irrefutable answer. </p><p>4. Although science and religion have different methods, their purpose is the same, to help humankind understand the world and find happiness. Science provides rational understanding, while religion provides spiritual meaning. </p><p>5. Many scientists also have religious beliefs. The two are not exclusive and need only be understood and practiced under different modes of thinking. However, Feynman once emphasized in his book that "if scientists choose to maintain religious beliefs, they need to spend a lot of effort to maintain the complete unity of two worldviews." According to statistics, the vast majority of scientists choose atheism or irreligion. Although the same person's mind is fully capable of switching between these two modes. </p><p>At the same time, in terms of the spiritual and meaningful levels, philosophy and psychology can also provide some alternative explanations to religion, but in very different ways.</p><p>1. Philosophy and psychology mainly use reason, logic and evidence to think about and argue issues, while religion relies more on intuition, faith and experience. </p><p>2. The purpose of philosophy and psychology is to understand the spiritual and meaningful, while the purpose of religion is practice and enlightenment, to find the direction and comfort of life. Religion is a way of life, not just a way of thinking. </p><p>3. The topics discussed in philosophy and psychology are usually limited to human society and real life, while religion involves a wider range, including the supernatural, mysterious and incomprehensible parts of religious belief.  </p><p>4. The conclusions of philosophy and psychology need to be argued and verified, while religious doctrines are mostly based on experience and faith, without requiring a fully rational explanation or proof. </p><p>Therefore, although philosophy, psychology and religion all focus on the human spirit and the meaningful level, they differ in methodology, purpose and scope of discussion. Philosophy and psychology emphasize reason more and are part of science, while religion involves a wider range and emphasizes faith rather than pure reason alone. However, their purpose and ultimate concern are somewhat similar, all exploring the meaning and value of human existence. Therefore, they are not simply opposed but may also permeate and learn from each other.</p><p><b>What is the philosophical origin of the conflict between religion and science?</b></p><p>Modern science is rooted in <b>rationalism</b>. Its basic viewpoints are:</p><p>1. The importance of reason. Rationalism values human rational judgment and believes that reason is an important means to know the truth and solve problems. Reason is superior to other sources of knowledge such as sensibility, experience, authority and tradition. </p><p>2. The authority of individual reason. Rationalism emphasizes the use of reason by individuals to make judgments and think, weakening external authority. Reason gives individuals intellectual autonomy and freedom. </p><p>3. Methodology of rational doubt. Rationalism adopts the method of rational doubt, maintains a doubtful attitude towards all authority and existing opinions, and verifies them according to the standards of rational judgment. Knowledge that has not been proved by reason cannot stand. </p><p>4. Empirical principle. Rationalism believes that theories and knowledge should be based on facts and evidence. Theories that do not conform to actuality and cannot be verified are not credible. Reason needs to rely on experience. </p><p>5. Rationalism. Rationalism emphasizes the deductive reasoning method, deducing specific conclusions from general principles. This logical deduction from top to bottom is an important way for reason to operate. </p><p>6. Enlightenment ideals. Rationalism emphasizes the awakening and liberation of human reason, believing that rational enlightenment can transcend ignorance and prejudice to achieve progress in knowledge and individual autonomy. This reflects the political and spiritual connotations of rationalism. </p><p>7. Scientific reason. Rationalism regards reason as the basis for scientific development and believes that scientific reason can serve social progress and human liberation. The spirit of scientific reason is an important embodiment of rationalism. </p><p>Therefore, rationalism is a philosophical view that emphasizes rational judgment and individual freedom, pursues progress in knowledge and spiritual liberation. It attaches great importance to reason and experience, advocates the scientific rational spirit and doubtful attitude, and strives to transform society through rational enlightenment and realize human autonomy and liberation. The ideas of rationalism have had a profound impact on Western society, promoting social change and civilization development. </p><p>The philosophical basis of religion mainly includes: </p><p>1. Supernaturalism. Religion admits the existence of the supernatural, such as God, gods, etc. This is contrary to naturalism and is a fundamental premise of religious philosophy. </p><p>2. Spiritual original theory. Religious philosophy believes that the spirit or mind is the most fundamental existence. The material world depends on the spirit, which is the original. This provides a metaphysical basis for religious ideas. </p><p>3. Predestination theory and free will theory. Religious philosophy often understands human destiny based on the will of God or gods. But humans also have a certain degree of freedom and moral choice responsibility. The two coexist in religion and constitute a view of human destiny. </p><p>4. Teleology. Religious philosophy understands that the world and human life are purposeful and guided by the supreme being. This teleological view is opposed to accidentalism and is an important support for religious belief. </p><p>5. Absolute value theory. Religious philosophy believes that there is an absolute and unchanging moral truth or law. This provides a basis for religious moral views and also enables religion to have a theoretical basis for regulating human behavior. </p><p>6. Revelation theory. Religious philosophy believes that humankind can gain insight into the supreme being through some mysterious means. This kind of revelation does not depend on reason or experience and has a unique authority, which supports the formation of religious doctrines. </p><p>7. Faith transcends reason. Religious philosophy values faith and believes that faith is superior to reason. Reason has its limitations on religious truth and needs to transcend through faith. This gives religion an irrational character. </p><p>In addition to the above commonalities, the philosophical foundations of different religions also have their own characteristics, such as the theory of reincarnation and liberation in Hinduism, the theory of suffering and emptiness in Buddhism, the theory of salvation and the concept of heaven in Christianity, etc. But these characteristics are still based on supernaturalism, absolute value theory and faith transcending reason. Therefore, the philosophical foundation of religion lies in the recognition of the supernatural existence, the theory of spirit or mind as the origin, the combination of teleology and the view of predestination, the affirmation of absolute values and morality, and the view that faith is superior to reason. This provides metaphysical and methodological bases for various religious doctrines. Different religions have developed their own unique worldviews and views of life on this common foundation.</p><p><b>Does the irrationality of religious belief limit the development of science?</b></p><p>1. To some extent, the irrational factors of religious belief do restrict the development of science. Religious doctrines often do not require rational evidence, which contradicts the scientific spirit. Religious authorities also resisted some scientific discoveries, such as the church's opposition to the Copernican theory. </p><p>2. However, the influence of religious belief has weakened in modern society, and its restrictive effect on science has also decreased accordingly. The rise of modern science has also weakened religious authority, and the relationship between the two has become more separated and independent. </p><p>3. The development of science has in turn weakened some religious doctrines, making them more rational and enlightened. Religious understanding and tolerance of science are also improving. Conflicts between them are weakening. </p><p>4. Religious belief is not entirely irrational. It plays a positive role in human spiritual life and the search for the meaning of life, which is conducive to the social stability necessary for scientific development. Religious belief also meets certain spiritual needs of man, and its existence provides a psychological basis and social conditions for the development of science. </p><p>5. Historically, some religions have also advocated reason and education and promoted technological progress. Enlightened religious leaders also support scientific work. Religions have funded universities and scholars to promote education development. </p><p>Therefore, although the irrational factors of religious belief have restricted the development of science to some extent, their influence is two-way. The promoting role of religion on science cannot be ignored. In modern society, the restrictions of religion on science are decreasing, and the two play complementary roles in spiritual life. Religious belief provides a social basis for scientific development, while scientific progress makes religion more rational and enlightened. In summary, it is difficult to absolutely limit the restrictive effect of religious irrational factors on scientific development. The relationship between the two is complex and dynamic, with both contradictions and mutual promotion. Religious belief has a positive impact on human spiritual life and social progress, which is conducive to scientific development. Historically, religion has also shown a rational side to promote technological and educational progress. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to simply determine that religious belief absolutely limits scientific development. This relationship needs to be fully investigated in historical context. In conclusion, religious belief and scientific development have a complex, complementary and sometimes conflicting relationship. They meet different human needs and cannot replace each other. Seeking common ground while shelving differences is most conducive to human progress.  Throughout human history, the co-development of science and religion, with mutual understanding and promotion, has led to the prosperity of civilizations. Absolutism and extreme opposition are detrimental. The future relationship between science and religion deserves more objective and concrete analysis in a guiding spirit of communication, inclusion and co-development.</p><p><b>Do people today still need religious belief?</b></p><p>1. For some people, religious belief is still very important. It can provide spiritual sustenance and meaning of life, meet people's pursuit of eternal life and perfection, and bring order and direction to life. For these people, religious belief is still necessary. </p><p>2. But for others, religious belief may not be so strongly needed. The secularization of modern social lifestyles and the rise of scientific rationalism have enabled some people to find the meaning and value of life without relying on religion. </p><p>3. The development of modern society has also enhanced people's access to knowledge and experience of life, which weakens the necessity of religious belief. People can obtain spiritual sustenance or life guidance through other means. </p><p>4. Religious belief is a personal choice. In modern society, whether a person needs religious belief depends on his own choice and needs. Not everyone needs it, nor does everyone not need it.  </p><p>5. However, for society as a whole, the existence of religious belief still plays an important role in maintaining social order, providing meaning and spiritual pillars, and is still closely related to modern society. </p><p>Therefore, whether an individual needs to believe in religion depends on personal choice and needs. But from the perspective of society as a whole, religious belief still has important practical significance, plays an irreplaceable role in modern society, and constitutes an important part of human spirituality. For many people religious belief is still necessary. But it needs to adapt to modern society and meet people's ever-chan</p><p><b>Will religion disappear?</b></p><p>1. Science and technological progress will not necessarily lead to the disappearance of religion. Although scientific progress has challenged some religious doctrines, religion is also constantly modernizing and reforming to adapt to social development. The spiritual needs met by religion will not disappear because of technology. </p><p>2. Globalization has intensified exchanges and competition between world religions, which may lead to the decline of traditional religions but also promote the rise of new religions and mixed belief systems. </p><p>3. Young people are less interested in religion, but the increasing demand for religion in later life may offset this effect. The meaning of life and the confusion of existence are eternal questions, which provide a basis for the survival of religion. </p><p>4. Political and social factors also affect the rise and fall of religion. The religious policies of some regimes may weaken the influence of religion, but political turmoil may also increase the need for religious comfort. </p><p>5. Economic factors also play a role. Economic crises may lead people to seek spiritual solace in religion, while economic prosperity may reduce such needs. </p><p>In summary, the disappearance of religion depends on the dynamic balance of social development. The demand for religion is eternal, but the forms and influences of religion will change over time. Some traditional religions may decline, but new religions and more modern belief systems will emerge. As an important means to meet human spiritual needs, religion is unlikely to disappear completely. But its role in social life will shift from dominant to companion, with relatively declining influence. Scientific progress and the rise of rationalism will not eradicate religion but will promote its more modern and rational development.</p><p>Therefore, it is unrealistic to simply predict the disappearance of religion. But we can expect religion to become more modern and rational, and its influence will also decline relatively. The eternity of religious needs and the changes in the forms of religion will guide the evolutionary development of religion in the future.</p>
