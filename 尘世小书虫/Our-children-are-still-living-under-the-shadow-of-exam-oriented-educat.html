          <p>In North America, there is a belief that the education system focuses more on providing a joyful learning experience for children, rather than solely academic achievement. Some people argue that North American children don't learn much in school because it is more like playtime for them. However, it is important to note that this perception may not necessarily reflect the actual learning outcomes of North American students.</p><p>There is also a common perception that North American children lack basic math skills. For example, some people may point out instances where fifth or sixth-grade children struggle to solve simple math problems like 1/2 + 1/3, often arriving at incorrect answers such as 1/5. It's important to recognize that these anecdotes may not be representative of the overall mathematical proficiency of North American students.</p><p>Regarding the dominance of Chinese children in national math competitions, such as the Math Olympiad, it is worth noting that it doesn't necessarily indicate superior intelligence of the Chinese population as a whole. It may be due to a combination of factors such as cultural emphasis on academic achievements, rigorous preparation, and a specific interest in math among Chinese students.</p><p>Similarly, when people attribute the lack of Chinese entrepreneurs or executives in Silicon Valley to racial discrimination or cultural differences, it oversimplifies the complex dynamics of entrepreneurship and leadership. Success in these areas depends on a multitude of factors, including individual abilities, opportunities, networking, and personal choices.</p><p>The education systems in China and Canada differ in their teaching approaches. Chinese education often follows a more traditional, teacher-centered approach focused on knowledge transmission and memorization. This approach emphasizes standardized learning, where teachers play a prominent role in delivering information, and students are passive recipients. It aims to quickly impart a large amount of knowledge and develop problem-solving skills suitable for exam-oriented education. However, it may hinder the cultivation of creativity, critical thinking, and independent learning, and may lead to student fatigue and disengagement.</p><p>On the other hand, Canadian education often combines both teacher-centered and student-centered approaches, emphasizing inquiry-based learning. Teachers act as guides, stimulating students' thinking and encouraging them to actively explore and discover knowledge. This approach fosters problem-solving abilities, research skills, innovation, and student autonomy. It aims to create an open learning environment where students are encouraged to think critically and pursue personalized learning. However, implementing such an approach requires skilled and flexible teachers and may face challenges related to curriculum design and addressing individual differences.</p><p>It is important to recognize that the impact of education systems on students' outcomes is multifaceted, and factors beyond the education system itself can influence individual achievements. The interplay of cultural values, parenting styles, socioeconomic factors, and personal motivations all contribute to the overall educational experience and outcomes.</p><p>Chinese parents need to recognize the following realities when it comes to their children's education in their adopted country. China and Canada have significant differences in teaching methods and approaches.</p><p>1. Teaching Methods:</p><p>- China: Traditionally, Chinese teaching methods have been teacher-centered, emphasizing knowledge transmission and rote memorization. However, in recent years, some high-quality educational institutions in major Chinese cities have been promoting more inquiry-based teaching methods, encouraging student engagement and critical thinking.</p><p>- Canada: Canadian teaching methods focus more on student-centered learning and active participation. Inquiry-based and experiential learning approaches are widely used in Canadian education, encouraging students to acquire knowledge and understanding through problem-solving, collaboration, and hands-on experiences.</p><p>2. Student Engagement:</p><p>- China: Traditionally, the Chinese education system emphasizes discipline, obedience, and rote memorization. Students are often seen as passive recipients of knowledge.</p><p>- Canada: Canadian education values student-centered learning and active participation. Students are encouraged to ask questions, collaborate, solve problems, and express their own opinions. Teachers play the role of facilitators and guides, encouraging students to think critically and develop independent learning skills.</p><p>3. Assessment Methods:</p><p>- China: In China, exam scores are typically the main evaluation criteria. The traditional education system places more emphasis on assessing knowledge recall and test-taking abilities.</p><p>- Canada: Canadian education emphasizes diversified assessment methods, including project assignments, group work, presentations, and oral reports. Teachers consider multiple aspects of students' performance, including knowledge, skills, critical thinking, and creative expression.</p><p>As these two teaching methods represent two distinct educational philosophies, with the former focusing on knowledge transmission and the latter on skill development, if Chinese parents use the standards of exam-oriented education to evaluate Canadian students, their academic performance naturally cannot be compared to students who have solely received rote learning education.</p><p>And North America is not the environment where Chinese parents grew up (a hierarchical society), and if they don't "get involved," they face the risk of downward social mobility. The primary goal of education in North America is to cultivate children into responsible citizens who possess basic employability skills. These are the basics of being a North American society member.</p><p>For example, as a North American, one should possess the following moral qualities: a qualified citizen should have qualities of respecting others' rights, dignity, and diversity. They should respect others' perspectives, cultural backgrounds, and beliefs, and approach different populations with an inclusive attitude. A qualified citizen should willingly take on their civic responsibilities, including obeying the law, participating in community affairs, voting and engaging in elections, abiding by public order, and striving to contribute to society. Fairness and justice: a qualified citizen should support and pursue fairness and justice. They should oppose discrimination and unequal treatment, and strive for equal opportunities and rights for all. A qualified citizen should act with honesty and integrity as a guideline. They should keep promises, be honest and trustworthy, and follow moral and professional codes of conduct. A qualified citizen should care about social issues and actively participate in resolving and improving the social environment. They should take responsibility for societal needs and problems and contribute to the interests of the community and society.</p><p>A significant portion of the compulsory education in North America over the past decade has been aimed at shaping the next generation into the aforementioned adults. Such individuals may have been considered role models in China several decades ago, but in North America, they might be seen as ordinary people.</p><p>An ordinary Chinese person may possess simple qualities of kindness, generosity, sympathy, or care. However, North America has systematically ingrained these concepts in the minds of its citizens for over a decade, and it is enough to deal with complex situations involving ethics and morality. Let's take a common example: when discussions in North American classrooms touch on profound concepts such as "fairness, justice, and equality," Chinese students often find themselves speechless, while local Caucasian and African-American children speak fluently. This may have a lot to do with the parents of Chinese children. Their parents are more concerned about their children demonstrating academic abilities. They believe that their children's moral character building is sufficient with positive influences from their immediate family. Children do not need an in-depth understanding of relevant theories; they don't need to read Rousseau or Jefferson. However, the cultural origins of capitalist society are fundamentally cut off once they enter the social and cultural domain as adults. Chinese children may become useful "tools" due to their academic abilities, but that's about it.</p><p>In conclusion, teaching methods and approaches are important components of education as they influence the effectiveness of teachers' instruction and students' learning outcomes. Different teaching methods and approaches have their own advantages and limitations, born out of different social contexts, and suited for different educational goals and learning needs. Therefore, no teaching method or approach is inherently the best or worst.</p><p>At the same time, parents often apply their own successful experiences from exam-oriented education as requirements and judgment criteria for their children. This is because they may consider these experiences as the key to their own success and hope to help their children achieve similar accomplishments through the same means.</p><p>However, it's important to note that each child is a unique individual with different interests, abilities, and learning styles. While parents' successful experiences may provide some guidance, directly applying them to their children may not necessarily be suitable, considering the national context.</p><p>When educating their children, parents can consider the following points: understanding their children's interests and potentials, helping them develop their strengths, and supporting them in pursuing their own interests and goals. Try to provide a more diverse and comprehensive educational experience, including cultivation in arts, sports, social skills, etc., to promote their overall development. Encourage exploratory learning, foster their creative thinking, problem-solving skills, and habits of independent learning. This will help them deal with different challenges and opportunities in the future. Establish good communication and interaction with children, understand their needs, concerns, and goals. Respect their wishes and interests and collaborate with them to develop suitable learning plans.</p><p>Most importantly, parents should maintain a flexible mindset, be willing to adapt to changes, and provide support and guidance in their children's education. Each child has their own developmental trajectory and unique needs. Focus on their overall growth and well-being, not just test scores.</p>
