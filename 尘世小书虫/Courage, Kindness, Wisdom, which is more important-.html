          <p>Courage, Kindness, Wisdom, which is more important?<br></p><p>Courage is the most precious wealth in a person, without exception. It is a prerequisite for a person to become a person, it is the most basic quality, but many people lack it.</p><p> It's worth thinking about: you are very kind, now a bad guy comes, He is terrifying. He commands you to do some harmful things. If you obey, are you still a "kind" person? From an inner perspective, you are kind. From a realistic perspective, there is no difference between you and an evil accomplice. The effects of what you do are the same. </p><p>This is why "courage" is the top priority and key quality in a person. When you lack enough courage, any external things, evil/vulgar/hypocritical/sinister/greedy/decadent/cruel/ungrateful, etc., can easily control you. Then, whether you are really "kind" or not doesn't really matter. That is to say, without enough courage, you can't even guarantee that you will become yourself, you can only become a tool controlled by others. </p><p>Of course, courageous and kind people may also be deceived and blinded, and end up doing bad things. So wisdom is also needed. </p><p>However, without courage, you can't even be a "bad guy" because you can't have the minimum "free will". Any good or bad factors can control you, you are just a "tool" without a brain. This is not even human. Bad guys, at least, can still be considered alive. People without courage can only be brainless sheep. </p><p>School/parents/the classical books tell you to be courageous and kind, which means that you must have enough courage to maintain your precious qualities and guard them. Whether it is wisdom or kindness, any precious quality requires courage to guarantee. Otherwise, you don't even dare to develop it, let alone possess it. </p><p>All truly kind people must be brave. Kind people without courage can only be slowly distorted by society into evil accomplices. This is also why many "brave" people always have a breath of "foolishness", because those decadent seductions are hard to affect them. In the words of the villain, they are called "stinky and rock hard”, like a stubborn stone, dull and insensitive to temptation, like an ascetic. Because they know that so-called decadence is actually giving up courage and choosing the path of opportunism and surrender for fear of suffering. In order to be comfortable, they threw away their original excellent qualities. It's too damn hard. Many people are even more afraid of hardship than death. </p><p>Of course, here we are talking about inner courage, not the kind of courage that is aggressive, cruel, crude, or resorting to force. If you can't beat the bad guys, you can only compromise temporarily, and then find indirect ways to find their weaknesses and try to overthrow them, that takes courage. If you can't beat the bad guys, and end up compromising all the time, and are even afraid to have the idea of resisting, then you're done. Society has not only hypocrisy and evil, but also greed and negativity. There are too many bad things. And training courage is precisely the first step to counter them. It leaves a glimmer of hope.</p>
