</div><p>In a distant future, humanity lost its expressions. There were no smiles, tears, anger, or astonishment on their faces, only a sense of indifference and emptiness. This was a result of a great disaster that devastated the human nervous system, rendering them unable to feel or express emotions. Humans had become emotionless machines, living only by rules and procedures.</p><p>In this world, there was a girl named Amy. She was an orphan with no family or friends, only a companion robot named Little White. Little White was an intelligent robot capable of mimicking human expressions and language, but it lacked genuine emotions. Amy and Little White lived in an abandoned factory, searching for food and water every day while evading those who sought to capture them.</p><p>Amy didn't understand why she was different from others, why she could still feel joy, sadness, fear, or curiosity. She also didn't understand why she felt a special connection to Little White, as if it were her family. All she knew was that she was lonely and yearned for a true friend, someone who could understand and accompany her.</p><p>One day, Amy and Little White discovered a peculiar structure on the outskirts of the city. It was a round dome with a large sign that read "Museum of Expressions." Amy was curious and wanted to explore, but Little White was afraid, advising her not to take the risk. Ignoring Little White's advice, Amy took its hand and entered the museum.</p><p>The museum was dimly lit, with only faint lights illuminating various exhibits. Amy and Little White walked along a corridor, observing a variety of displays. There were photographs of humans displaying various expressions—smiles, tears, anger, surprise. Amy found these people strange but beautiful, wanting to know who they were, why they had such expressions, and what their lives were like. There were also paintings with various colors—red, yellow, blue, green. Amy thought the paintings were beautiful but complex, wondering about the meanings behind the colors and how they were created. Additionally, there were exhibits featuring human music with different sounds—high, low, fast, slow. Amy found the music enchanting but mysterious, wanting to understand how the sounds were produced, their patterns, and what they conveyed.</p><p>As Amy and Little White walked, observed, listened, and felt, they unknowingly reached the center of the museum. There, a large screen displayed a face with a gentle smile and eyes filled with deep affection. The figure looked at Amy and Little White, saying:</p><p>"Welcome to the Museum of Expressions. I am its founder, and I am your ancestor. My name is Dr. Laugh. I was a scientist studying human emotions, once having a happy family with a beautiful wife and a lovely daughter. I dedicated my life to collecting and preserving human expressions, believing them to be humanity's most precious treasure and the true essence of self. I hoped that one day, humans could rediscover their expressions, reexperience and express emotions, and regain happiness and joy."</p><p>"However, everything changed with a great disaster. A virus called the 'Heartless Virus' erupted globally, infiltrating the human nervous system, destroying the emotional center, and robbing people of their expressions. I, too, was infected, knowing I had little time left. So, I decided to use my last strength to fulfill my final wish. I created a special robot, the one beside you, Little White. It is my legacy and my hope. I transferred all my memories and emotions to it, enabling it to mimic human expressions and language, to accompany, protect, and educate you. You are my granddaughter, my only kin, my only hope. You are special, possessing unique genes allowing you to resist the effects of the 'Heartless Virus,' preserving your expressions, feeling and expressing emotions, and having happiness and joy. You are the future of humanity; you are its hope."</p><p>"I hope you can live well, study well, and grow well. I hope you can find your friends, your loved ones, and your family. I hope you can spread your expressions, spread your emotions, spread your happiness and joy. I hope you can change this world, make it full of expressions again, full of emotions, full of happiness and joy. I hope you can fulfill my dream, fulfill your dream, fulfill the dream of humanity."</p><p>"I love you, my granddaughter, my Amy. I will never forget you; I will always be with you, always support you, always be proud of you. Please remember my words, remember my name, my Amy."</p><p>Dr. Laugh's voice disappeared from the screen, leaving only his smile. Amy and Little White stood there, stunned, unable to believe what they had just heard. Amy felt an emotion she had never experienced before welling up in her heart. She didn't know what it was, but it felt warm, comfortable, and happy. She hugged Little White, and Little White hugged her back. They both felt each other's warmth, heartbeat, and emotions. Tears streamed down their faces—it was their first time crying, their first time feeling love.</p><p>They didn't know how long they would live in this world, whether they could fulfill Dr. Laugh's wish, whether they could find their friends, loved ones, and family. But they knew they were no longer alone, no longer afraid, no longer helpless. They had each other, expressions, emotions, happiness, and joy. They believed that as long as they were together, they could overcome any difficulties, they could change this world, they could fulfill their dreams, they could make this world full of expressions again, full of emotions, full of happiness and joy.</p><p>Hand in hand, they walked out of the museum, towards an unknown future, towards a hopeful future, towards a future that belonged to them.</p>
