<p>"Children should study hard and find good jobs when they grow up!" "Every subject's grade should not be lower than 95, otherwise, how can you get into a good university?!" "You should memorize every knowledge from the textbooks and be able to apply them accurately in problem-solving!"... I think many parents nowadays use these kinds of words to educate their children because they themselves grew up hearing similar instructions.</p><p>I wonder if every parent understands the basis of such education. What are the practical significances today? Is it still the best approach to persuade children to accept education? We still need to reflect from a historical perspective.</p><p>Human society has gone through agricultural society, industrial society, and is currently in the information society. Over thousands of years, the core concepts of education have continuously adapted to changes in social forms.</p><p>In the agricultural society, the core idea of education was mainly to pass on and maintain social stability, values, and vocational skills. The purpose of education was to cultivate the next generation to become qualified farmers, craftsmen, or practitioners of other specific professions. The focus was on teaching agricultural knowledge, manual skills, and family values. Education revolved around agricultural production, farming techniques, household management, etc., aiming to ensure the economic production and orderly life of society. The education method was usually oral instruction and the transmission of practical experience. Older or experienced individuals took on the role of teachers, guiding and demonstrating to the younger generation. The learning process involved participation and imitation through practice. Children learned agricultural skills and family responsibilities by observing, assisting, and imitating the behavior of adults. In the agricultural society, the emphasis of education was on cultivating children to adapt to specific roles in society and inheriting the culture and values of society. The purpose of education was to ensure social stability, prosperity, and maintain traditional social order and occupational division.</p><p>The Core Concepts of Education in Agricultural Society had the following characteristics:</p><p>1. Utilitarianism: Education mainly focused on practicality, emphasizing the training and transmission of labor skills to supply the workforce for agricultural society.</p><p>2. Morality: Education emphasized the inculcation of traditional virtues and ethical morals, requiring students to possess virtues such as filial piety, diligence, and obedience to rules.</p><p>3. Practicality: Knowledge was primarily transmitted through direct teaching by masters, and education emphasized practical operations and the practice of manual skills.</p><p>4. Conservatism: Education content and methods were mostly inherited from ancestors, and societal changes were slow, resulting in a more conservative approach to education.</p><p>5. Family-oriented: Education primarily took place within the family, with parents directly responsible for their children's education. Learning was integrated into daily life, with less emphasis on formal schooling.</p><p>6. Loyalty: Education demanded students to adhere to traditional ideas, respect authority, and follow the footsteps of their ancestors. Independent thinking and innovation were not encouraged.</p><p>7. Selectivity: Educational opportunities were mainly available to the upper social classes, with education focusing more on grooming the offspring of the ruling class rather than being universally accessible.</p><p>In the period of industrial society, the core concepts of education mainly aimed to meet the needs of industrialized society and to cultivate a workforce and citizens adapted to industrial economy and social structure. The purpose of education was to develop workers equipped with basic knowledge and skills to meet the needs of industrial production. The focus was on providing basic education, including subjects such as reading, writing, arithmetic, and basic sciences. Additionally, the education system rigorously selected students with stronger learning abilities to receive specialized higher education to fulfill the demand for engineers, scientists, and other positions in the industrial society. Moreover, education placed emphasis on qualities required by the industrial society, such as discipline, obedience, and punctuality. The education system gradually shifted towards a centralized school system, where schools became the primary places for education, and students were taught in a centralized manner based on age and subjects. The education content became standardized, following a unified curriculum and teaching methods. Teachers played an important role in schools, responsible for imparting knowledge, discipline management, and evaluating students' learning outcomes. The educational viewpoint of the industrial society emphasized practicality and vocational adaptability. The goal of education was to cultivate a workforce that met the demands of the industrial society, providing the necessary skills and qualities for students to enter factories, offices, and other industrial positions. The focus of education was to provide students with employment opportunities and economic independence after graduation.</p><p>The core concepts of education in the industrial society have the following characteristics:</p><p>1. Knowledge-oriented: In the rapidly growing industrial society, education began to focus on knowledge transmission, encouraging rationality and science.</p><p>2. Citizenship: With the rise of civil society, education aimed to cultivate civic consciousness and ethics, pursuing equality, freedom, and democracy.</p><p>3. Standardization: The education system began to standardize, implementing compulsory education. Textbooks and teaching methods became more unified and standardized.</p><p>4. Research-oriented: Universities began to emerge, and education started to value theoretical learning and research. It aimed to cultivate advanced intellectuals and technological talents.</p><p>5. Selectivity: Education still maintained a selective nature, emphasizing the development of elites and future leaders. However, educational opportunities also started to become more widespread.</p><p>6. Practicality: Education content became practical-oriented, focusing on training craftsmen and skilled workers for the industrial society.</p><p>7. Scientificity: Education leaned towards rationalism and empiricism, emphasizing the construction of disciplinary systems and scientific teaching methods.</p><p>8. Universality: The target of education expanded from a minority wealthy class to encompass the entire population, aiming for universal education.</p><p>9. Lifelong learning: With accelerated social changes, the educational viewpoint began to value the cultivation of learning abilities and lifelong learning.</p><p>In the information society era, to adapt to the rapidly changing and knowledge-explosive social environment, the core concepts of education gradually evolved. The cultivation of independent thinking ability and the pursuit of truth became leading ideas. Emphasis was placed on developing students' creativity, critical thinking, and information processing skills.</p><p>The purpose of education was to cultivate students as lifelong learners with comprehensive knowledge and skills, capable of becoming active participants with values and social responsibility. The focus was on developing students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. Education should not only focus on knowledge transmission but also cultivate students' ability to think and judge independently. Independent thinking means students can think independently, analyze information, and form their own opinions and judgments. This requires the cultivation of their logical thinking, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. By cultivating the ability to think independently, students can make decisions and solve problems independently without relying on others' opinions and views.</p><p>The pursuit of truth means students should have a desire to understand factual truths and seek truth. This requires the cultivation of their curiosity, spirit of exploration, and critical thinking. By cultivating the willingness to pursue truth, students will actively seek information and conduct research and investigations to form comprehensive and accurate cognition and perspectives.</p><p>The importance of this viewpoint lies in the fact that independent thinking and the pursuit of truth are the foundations for cultivating students' lifelong learning and growth. In modern society, where information is abundant and diverse, we face various viewpoints and information bombardment. Only with the ability to think independently and the willingness to pursue truth can students better understand and cope with these challenges.</p><p>By cultivating independent thinking and the pursuit of truth, education can help students develop critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving abilities, making them individuals with thoughts, judgment, and independent insights. At the same time, it also enables them to make wise decisions and the right choices when facing the complexities of the real world.</p><p>Education has become more flexible and personalized. With the development of technology, learning has become more autonomous and diverse. Students can access knowledge through the internet and online resources, engaging in self-directed learning and research. Personalized instruction is becoming a trend, providing customized educational approaches based on students' interests, abilities, and learning styles.</p><p>In the information society, educational perspectives emphasize lifelong learning and adaptability. Education is no longer confined to the school stage but is a continuous learning process. Students need to possess the ability for self-directed learning and self-development, continuously adapting and responding to the rapidly changing social and career demands.</p><p>Furthermore, education in the information society also emphasizes the cultivation of students' teamwork, communication, and social skills to meet the collaborative and interactive requirements of the information society. The goal of education is to foster well-rounded individuals with critical thinking, innovation, and adaptability.</p><p>Upon reflecting on the phrases commonly used by parents to educate their children, we can realize that these teachings are based on the educational model of the industrial society. It emphasizes exams and grades, developing specialized skills and knowledge to adapt to the industrialization and modernization of society, improving productivity and efficiency. Such teachings may have had some relevance in the past when societal demands and competition were measured by these standards. However, in the information society, this type of instruction may not be the optimal solution to persuade children to embrace education because the information society requires talented individuals with comprehensive abilities and creativity, rather than individuals solely focused on exams and memorizing knowledge. The information society necessitates innovation and communication, not standardization and uniformity. The information society calls for personalization and diversity, not homogeneity and conformity.</p><p>Parents need to adjust their educational beliefs and methods. Firstly, they need to understand the characteristics and trends of the information society, recognizing that the purpose and significance of education are no longer solely for exams and grades but to cultivate their children's comprehensive abilities and creativity. Secondly, they should respect their children's individuality and choices, avoiding imposing their own will and expectations. Instead, they should encourage children to discover their own interests and potentials, supporting them in exploring different fields and directions. Thirdly, they should establish good communication and trust with their children, not just instructing and criticizing but also listening and understanding. They should not just command and control but cooperate and negotiate. Lastly, they should provide their children with more freedom and space, allowing them to have exposure to diverse information and cultures, providing opportunities for engagement in various activities and practices, and creating opportunities for them to showcase their multiple talents and achievements.</p>
