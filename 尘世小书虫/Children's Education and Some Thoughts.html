        <div class="show-content">
          <p>Some parents, when they cannot achieve their own ideals, will impose their ideals on their children. They never realize one thing: that every person is an independent individual.<br></p><p>As a result, they forcefully push their children to do things that challenge their physical and intellectual limits, putting immense pressure on them. However, they don't understand their own children at all. In their eyes, anything they don't understand themselves is not important, and making their children live according to their set standards is the most worthwhile thing.</p><p>You never know how terrifying the desires of these parents can be:</p><p>Making their children marry someone they don't love, making their children become independent while studying, making their children stay by their side, making their children pursue a career they are completely unsuited for, making their children live a life they are not willing to live.</p><p>What's even more frightening is that when you discuss this with them, they always tell you, "I'm doing it for your own good."</p><p>Parents usually act out of love and care, hoping to provide their children with the best opportunities and guidance for their future. However, excessive expectations and pressure can leave children feeling frustrated, anxious, and may cause them to lose interest and self-identity while pursuing their parents' set goals.</p><p>Communication is key to addressing this situation. Engaging in open and honest conversations with parents about your feelings, interests, and goals, and trying to establish mutual understanding and respect, is a positive approach. Parents should also strive to understand their children's individual needs and desires, and explore paths of development that suit them.</p><p>If parents want their children to lead a happy life, academic abilities are not the most important factor. It is important for children to have a positive character, to be honest and kind, to develop independent thinking and rational judgment, and to have a positive attitude towards life. These qualities will ensure that they find a compatible partner and build a happy family. The purpose of modern education is not to make individuals stand out, but to enable everyone to become optimistic and contribute to society. Whether to climb the social ladder or attend top universities like Tsinghua and Peking should be the child's own decision, not the parents' demand.</p><p>On the other hand, if a child has a bad character and is depressed all the time, how can they actively explore new worlds? Therefore, it is important to let children be free and happy from a young age. Children who love life, are positive and optimistic, can choose their own directions of interest as they grow up.</p><p>A child's happiness in life is not solely dependent on school education but is influenced by their original family environment. Why not focus more on personal development and growth? Not just one's career, but also caring for one's spouse and children, and elevating one's own spiritual level. These are the things that can provide the best for children!</p><p>No educational institution will preach this because they won't make money from it. They prefer parents to attend various training programs, creating more anxiety among parents.</p><p>In my view, China's education system still belongs to the educational concepts and system of the industrial society. It focuses on exams and selection, and employs a knowledge-based teaching approach. The education system in Western countries reflects the educational ideals of an information-based society. Pure knowledge acquisition is no longer emphasized; instead, Western education places more importance on a child's grasp of the knowledge system and their ability to explore new fields, with critical thinking skills occupying a significant position.</p><p>The educational system of an information-based society is not built upon completely overturning the educational system of an industrial society, but rather by making revisions and adding new educational methods on its basis. Gifted education in Western countries is a purer form of ability-based education.</p><p>To be frank, based on my understanding in recent years, even various academic competitions like Olympiads are products of an outdated industrial society. Currently, in North America, these competitions are predominantly participated in by children of Chinese descent. However, many parents still believe that Chinese people are intelligent and talented. In reality, many children who are genuinely interested in academic pursuits have already started participating in research projects at universities early on, honing their abilities.</p><p>From the perspective of the Chinese government, the biggest issue in education at present is the unequal distribution of educational resources. Why is it so difficult for children from Henan and Shandong to enter Tsinghua University? What makes them inferior to children from Beijing? This imbalance is particularly severe between urban and rural areas and across different regions. As for the problem of education not being applied practically, firstly, it is because of China's large scale, making educational system reforms challenging. Additionally, China's development is happening too rapidly, and education is struggling to keep up.</p>
