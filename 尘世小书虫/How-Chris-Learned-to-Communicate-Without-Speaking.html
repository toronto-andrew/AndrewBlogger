</div><p>Chris is a 9 years old boy who loves talking and making friends. He likes to share everything at all the time, from his favorite cartoons to his latest Lego creations. He is always the center of attention in his class and his family.</p><p>But one day, something happened that forced him to lose his ability of speaking. He was eating a candy when he accidentally swallowed it whole. He started choking and coughing, and his parents rushed him to the hospital. The doctors managed to remove the candy, but they also discovered that it had damaged his vocal cords. They told Chris and his parents that he would not be able to speak for a while, until his vocal cords healed.</p><p>Chris was devastated. He could not imagine a life without talking. How would he express his thoughts and feelings? How would he make new friends? How would he annoy his sister? He felt like he had lost a part of himself.</p><p>But Chris did not give up. He decided to find other ways to communicate without speaking. He learned sign language, which he taught to his friends and family. He used a tablet to type messages and play games. He drew pictures and comics to tell stories. He even learned to play the harmonica, which he used to make music and noises.</p><p>Chris discovered that there were many ways to communicate without speaking. He realized that he could still share everything at all the time, just in different forms. He also learned to listen more and appreciate the silence. He found out that sometimes, words are not enough to express what you feel.</p><p>Chris’s vocal cords eventually healed, and he was able to speak again. He was overjoyed, and so were his friends and family. He resumed his talking and making friends, but he also continued to use his other skills. He became a more versatile and creative communicator, and a more empathetic and attentive listener.</p><p>Chris learned a valuable lesson from his experience. He learned that communication is not only about speaking, but also about listening, understanding, and expressing. He learned that losing his ability of speaking did not mean losing his personality, but rather expanding it. He learned that sometimes, the best way to say something is to say nothing at all.</p>
